asked about Potato Planting  Selection Information ?,"Potato Planting  Selection Information: Choose certified pests and diseases. Use government funding infrastructure, or buy it from National Seed Corporation (National Syed Corporation).



Potatoes have grown full and sprouted on it. Puddle should be thick and well-fed. In the dark space, well-grown shoots are dried. If the veneer is kept in the bedroom, they should be kept in a well ventilated place for 8 to 10 days before impregnation and keep them in good light for better sprout. Generally, it is worthwhile to use 25 to 30 gm weight of 5 cm diameter for whole egg (uncut), generally for egg-shaped cultivation. It is very useful for large sized cultivation. If there is a large sized potato, then weigh it at 25 to 30 gm, and it should be 2 to 3 eyes. It is very important to break the grille and the germs on the spleen as well. Sprinkled spoons should be planted after drying for 10 to 12 hours."

Seeds and seed processing,"Seeds and seed processing

For more wheat production, there should be 20 to 22 lakh hectares of trees in the field. For this, 1oo kg of seeds per hectare should be used for sowing time.

Due to low temperature for late sowing, due to low wheat foliage the seed should be kept in the ratio of 125 to 150 kg per hectare. Seed treatment should be used for seeding of 75-100 kg per hectare.

Before sowing, seeds should be processed in the quantity of Captain or Thayaram fungicide with 3 gm per kg seed. Similarly, seeds of seed processing should be done for seeds of Azotobacter and phosphorous dissolving bacterial culture of 250 grams per 10 kg seed. This will increase the product by 10 to 15 percent."

For this, take a plastic strip of 15 to 20 centimeters in width and apply it to Greece. The bandage should be stacked, so the chicks stuck to Greece and died. Research has shown that malignant pests of the cryptolymus motrogeny have led to effective kidney pests. For this, leave 1000 to 1500 gooseberries per acre in the evening along the way. In the garden friends should not use harmful pesticides."

The weedicides of this group are mainly used in the management of post emergence, ie after frying it, it is used in the management of broad leaf weeds in one group crops. But if used incorrectly or in improperly, they can harm single-crop crops. These weedicides weaken weed cells by interrupting hormones, proteins, etc. in different parts of weeds, so they die after spraying in very short span."

cultivation tomato,"Planting

Seeds should be sown on the bed up to make seedlings. Before preparing the bed plant, make sure to double the soil by placing 2, 3 cloves of the cluster and fry the land. Gadi wafa is 1m The width should be 3 meters long and 15 cm tall. Grind 1 gram Fenugreek, mix 50 grams of soyafa and make the steam flat with the hand. Before sowing, wash 3 grams of thyroid fungicide. Planting of seeds should be planted with parallel fingers by cutting the waist and covering it with soil. Water should be provided with fenugreek leaves. After coming out of seed, after 10 to 12 days, give two grams of pearl in two rows and give 10 gram frontlets per foot. Keep the steam watered. To control the flowering and crushing disease, spray 15 days after seedling with 12 to 15 ml monochrotocos and 25 gm of diaethene-M-45 in 10 liters of water. The next two sprays should be done at intervals of 10 days. After 25 to 30 days of sowing, ie after seedling height of 12-15 cm, seedlings should be restored to the entire world. Give water to the vapor a day before planting the seedlings. Therefore, the seedlings are not easily damaged due to the roots of the seedlings. Planting of plants should always be done in the evening or after they are low."

farmer want to know poteto tuber treatment ?,"Fungicide and antioxidant medicine are treated in order to protect the tubers released from the cold storage to protect against fungi and bacteria-touched diseases. For this, water is taken by measuring in dramas, buckets, sounds or tins. The solution is prepared by mixing 5 grams of Imashishan-6 and halfgram i.e. 500 mg of Strophotocyclin antivytic powder per liter of water. After dipping the tubing for 15 minutes, the potato is removed from the solution and spread on a tropical or salty berry in a shady place so that the humidity of the tubers is reduced. Once the solution becomes too dirty or too little, then the new solution is prepared by throwing that solution and adding water to it again. Emission-6 is cheaper to prepare solutions for fungicide. In the absence of this, indofil M-45, capaffe or blitax can be dissolved in 2.5 gm per liter of water. This means that chemical seed treatment is essential.

The full quantity of P. and potash and half the quantity of urea should be mixed in the land during the final preparation of the field. The quantity of remaining urea should be given with spraying after 30-40 days in a standing crop.



Using the amount of micronutrients increases yield in the yield. 25 kg Gink sulphate should be used once per year in 3 years. Using drip irrigation and fertigation, the yield increases with the use of water-soluble fertilizers through drip irrigation."
